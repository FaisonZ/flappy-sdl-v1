# Flappy Bird Project

**Status**: Begun

My attempt at cloning flappy bird in SDL3

## Goals

* Make as quick as possible, maybe a couple of days
  * [x] Made with rects and debug text on 7/25
* Practice a real time game project
  * In contrast to tic-tac-toe, which responds to user events
* Continue to use the SDL Main Callback feature
  * Will build this project again in the future with a normal main() function
    to see the performance differences
* Use sprites instead of rendering rectangles
  * I'll develop with rectangles first, then add sprites on top of it
* STRETCH GOAL: Save high scores in a file

## Build

```bash
./bin/build.sh
```
